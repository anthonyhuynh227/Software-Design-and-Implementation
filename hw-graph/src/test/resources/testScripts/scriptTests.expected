#Create graph
created graph A
created graph B
created graph C

#Add nodes into graphs
added node b1 to B
added node c1 to C
added node c2 to C

#Add edges into graphs
added edge e1 from c1 to c2 in C
added edge e2 from c2 to c1 in C

#Print all nodes in the graph
A contains:
B contains: b1
C contains: c1 c2

#Print all child nodes of a node with outgoing edge
the children of c1 in C are: c2(e1)
the children of c2 in C are: c1(e2)
