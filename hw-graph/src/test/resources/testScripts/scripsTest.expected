# Tests that a graph can be created, a pair of nodes and
# an edge between them can be added, a single node can be added
# list all the nodes of a graph, all child from a single node.

# Create a graph
created graph A

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in A

#List all nodes from a graph
A contains: n1 n2

#List all children from a node
the children of n1 in A are: n2(e1)
