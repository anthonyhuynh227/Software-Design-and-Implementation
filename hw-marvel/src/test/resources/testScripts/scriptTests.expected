#Simple tests for a graph

#create graphs
created graph A
created graph B
created graph C

#Add nodes into graphs
added node a1 to A
added node b1 to B
added node b2 to B
added node c1 to C
added node c2 to C
added node c3 to C

#Add edges to graphs
added edge b12 from b1 to b2 in B
added edge b21 from b2 to b1 in B
added edge c12 from c1 to c2 in C
added edge c23 from c2 to c3 in C
added edge c13 from c1 to c3 in C

#Print all nodes in the graph
A contains: a1
B contains: b1 b2
C contains: c1 c2 c3

#Print all the child nodes with outgoing edge
the children of a1 in A are:
the children of b1 in B are: b2(b12)
the children of b2 in B are: b1(b21)
the children of c1 in C are: c2(c12) c3(c13)
the children of c2 in C are: c3(c23)
the children of c3 in C are:

#Test one node is not in graph
unknown: a2

#Test two nodes are not in graph
unknown: a2
unknown: a3

#Test path exist in graph
path from b1 to b2:
b1 to b2 via b12

path from b2 to b1:
b2 to b1 via b21

#Test path from a node to itself
path from b1 to b1:

#Test no path in graph
path from c3 to c1:
no path found

#Test shortest path
path from c1 to c3:
c1 to c3 via c13
